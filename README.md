Javascript Development Environment

# Starter Kit

why do you need a starter kit?

* Automated checklist
* Right thing become automoatic
* Rapid feedback

Your Starter Kit should consist of the following elements:

* [Editors and configuration](#1-editors-and-configuration)
* [Package Management](#2-package-management)
* []()

# 1. Editors and configuration
Choose an Editor.

### What to look for:

* Autocomplete
* Parse ES6 imports
* Report unused imports
* Automated refactoring
* built-in terminal

### Recommendation:

* [VSCode - Highly recommended for JS projects](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
* [Atom](https://atom.io/)
* [WebStorm - Not Free](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/)
* [Brackets](http://brackets.io/)

### Editor Config

[EditorConfig](http://editorconfig.org/) helps developers define and maintain consistent coding styles between different editors and IDEs.

Your team don't have to use the same editors to enjoy all of its consistency
Here's how this works:

* Create a file called `.editorconfig` and place it in the root of your project.
* setup the rules you need!
* [Here's is an example of typical configuration](.editorconfig);

You can adjust or add [any rule](http://docs.editorconfig.org/en/master/editorconfig-format.html#properties) to fit your project requirements.

PS: Some of the listed editors above require [plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=EditorConfig.EditorConfig) to support `EditorConfig`, E.g. VSCode.
